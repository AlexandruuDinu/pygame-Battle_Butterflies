In this mini-game, players fight each other using the common keyboard of the same computer.
The player on the left (Blue Butterfly) uses W-A-S-D to move and LCTRL to shoot.
The player on the right (purple butterfly) uses the arrows to move and RCTRL to shoot.

Each player has a maximum life of 10, and for each bullet he receives, the player is deducted 1 from his life. Each player can have a maximum of 3 bullets in the game area. The bullets they can use are endless.

When a player's life reaches 0, the game ends, and after 5 seconds, it resets and you can play again.
